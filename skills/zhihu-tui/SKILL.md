# zhihu-tui Skill

A TUI tool for interacting with Zhihu (知乎). Use it to fetch questions, answers, articles, pins (想法), user profiles, search content, browse hot list, and perform interactions like voting and following.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install (requires Python 3.10+)
uv tool install zhihu-tui
# Or: pipx install zhihu-tui
```

## Authentication

Most read commands work without login. Feed, favorites, following, and interactions require login.

```bash
zhihu status  # Check if logged in (exit code 0 = authenticated)
```

Authentication uses a 3-tier strategy:
1. Saved credential from `~/.zhihu-cli/credential.json`
2. Auto-extracts cookies from Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Brave
3. Manual login: `zhihu login --z-c0 <cookie_value>`

If the user mentions Zhihu operations requiring login and `zhihu status` fails, guide them to run `zhihu login --z-c0 <z_c0_cookie>`.

## Structured Output

All commands support `--yaml` and `--json` for machine-readable output. **Prefer `--yaml`** for AI agent usage — it's more token-efficient.

```bash
zhihu question 1908480548659225029 --yaml
zhihu hot -n 5 --yaml
zhihu search "python" -n 5 --yaml
zhihu pin 1999130577123636672 --yaml
```

Non-TTY stdout (piped) defaults to YAML automatically.

Structured output uses a stable envelope: `{ok, schema_version, data/error}`.

## Common Patterns for AI Agents

```bash
# Check login status before actions
zhihu status && zhihu vote answer 1908294773132981653

# Summarize a question — fetch answers first (primary source for summarization)
zhihu question 1908480548659225029 -n 5 --yaml

# Find a user and get their recent answers
zhihu search "张三" --type people -n 1 --yaml
zhihu user-answers <url_token> -n 5 --yaml

# Get hot topics for context
zhihu hot -n 10 --yaml

# Read an article for summarization
zhihu article 2010807391655052859 --yaml

# Read a pin (想法) for context
zhihu pin 1999130577123636672 --yaml

# Always prefer -n to limit results and save context window
zhihu search "python" -n 5 --yaml
```

## Error Handling

- Commands exit with code 0 on success, non-zero on failure
- `zhihu status` exits 0 only when authenticated
- Structured error codes: `not_authenticated`, `invalid_input`, `network_error`, `upstream_error`, `not_found`, `rate_limited`, `api_error`, `internal_error`
- When asked to summarize a question, fetch answers first — they are the primary source. Only fall back to comments when answers are insufficient.
